```

```

### 📊 Pricing Frameworks

#### 1. **Value-Based Pricing** (Recommended)

**Formula**: Price = % of Value Created

**Example**:
```
Client: Law firm
Problem: Manually processing 100 contracts/month
Time spent: 40 hours/month
Cost: $4,000/month (paralegal at $100/hr)

Your Solution: AI contract processor
Time saved: 35 hours/month
Value: $3,500/month

Your Price: $1,500/month (43% of value)
Client Saves: $2,000/month
ROI: 2.3x
```

**Pricing Rule**: Charge 30-50% of value created

---

#### 2. **Time-Based Pricing**

**Your Hourly Rate**: $100-300/hour (depending on expertise)

**Example**:
```
Project: Lead generation system
Estimated Time: 20 hours
Your Rate: $150/hour
Price: $3,000

Add Buffer: +20% for revisions
Final Price: $3,600
```

**Pros**: Simple, predictable
**Cons**: Penalizes efficiency (faster = less money)

---

#### 3. **Performance Pricing**

**Model**: Base fee + performance bonus

**Example**:
```
Service: Lead generation system
Base Fee: $2,000 (setup)
Performance: $50 per qualified lead generated

Month 1: 40 leads = $2,000
Month 2: 60 leads = $3,000
Month 3: 80 leads = $4,000
```

**Pros**: Aligned incentives, high upside
**Cons**: Risk if system underperforms

---

#### 4. **Tiered Pricing**

**Example: Social Media Automation**

| Feature | Starter | Pro | Enterprise |
|---------|---------|-----|------------|
| Price | $500/mo | $1,500/mo | $3,000/mo |
| Platforms | 2 | 5 | Unlimited |
| Posts/Month | 30 | 100 | Unlimited |
| AI Content | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Video Generation | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Support | Email | Slack | Dedicated |

**Strategy**: Most choose middle tier (anchoring effect)

---

### 💡 Pricing Psychology

**1. Anchor High**
```
❌ "This costs $5,000"
✅ "This saves you $50,000/year. Investment: $5,000"
```

**2. Show ROI**
```
"$8,500 implementation
Saves $68,640/year
Payback in 6.4 weeks
10-year value: $686,400"
```

**3. Payment Plans**
```
❌ "$10,000 upfront"
✅ "$3,000 upfront + $500/month for 14 months"
```

**4. Decoy Pricing**
```
Basic: $2,000
Pro: $5,000 ← Most popular
Enterprise: $15,000 (makes Pro look reasonable)
```

---

---

### 🛠️ Example: "The Resume Fixer" SaaS

**Problem**: Job seekers need ATS-optimized resumes

**Solution**: AI-powered resume optimization

**User Flow**:

```
1. User visits website (Softr/Lovable)
2. Upload resume (PDF)
3. Pay $5 (Stripe)
4. n8n Webhook receives:
   - File
   - Payment confirmation
   - User email

5. n8n Workflow:
   - Extract text from PDF
   - AI analyzes (GPT-4):
     * ATS compatibility
     * Keyword optimization
     * Formatting issues
     * Grammar errors
   - AI rewrites resume
   - Generate new PDF
   - Email to user

6. User receives optimized resume
```

**Economics**:
```
Price: $5
Cost per run:
- GPT-4 API: $0.10
- PDF processing: $0.02
- Email: $0.01
Total cost: $0.13

Profit per sale: $4.87 (97% margin!)

100 sales/day = $487/day = $14,610/month
1000 sales/day = $4,870/day = $146,100/month
```

**Marketing**:
- SEO ("ATS resume optimizer")
- Reddit (r/jobs, r/resumes)
- LinkedIn ads
- TikTok/YouTube tutorials

---

### 💡 SaaS Monetization Models

Or: $29/month for 500 credits
Best for: Variable usage
```

**4. Freemium**
```
Free: 10 uses/month
Pro: $29/month for unlimited
Best for: Viral growth
```

## 4.4 White-Labeling & Scaling

Revenue share: 70/30 or 80/20
```

**3. Marketplace**
