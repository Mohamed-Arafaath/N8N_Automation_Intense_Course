## 🎯 2. Pricing Strategies

### Value-Based Pricing (Recommended)

**Formula:** Price = 30-50% of value created

**Example:**
```
Client: Law firm
Manual Process: 100 contracts/month @ 40 hours
Labor Cost: $4,000/month

Your Solution: AI contract processor
Time Saved: 35 hours/month
Value Created: $3,500/month

Your Price: $1,500/month (43% of value)
Client Saves: $2,000/month
Client ROI: 2.3x
```

**ROI Presentation Script:**
```
"Here's what this means for you:

Current Cost: ${current_monthly_cost}
Our Solution: ${your_price}
Your Savings: ${savings} every month

That's ${annual_savings} per year.

Your investment pays for itself in {payback_weeks} weeks.

Over 3 years, you'll save ${three_year_savings}.

Does that ROI make sense?"
```

### Tiered Pricing Example

**Social Media Automation:**

| Feature | Starter | Pro | Enterprise |
|---------|---------|-----|------------|
| **Price** | $500/mo | $1,500/mo | $3,000/mo |
| Platforms | 2 | 5 | Unlimited |
| Posts/Month | 30 | 100 | Unlimited |
| AI Content | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Video Gen | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Support | Email | Slack | Dedicated |

**Psychology:** Most choose middle tier (anchoring effect)

## 📞 3. Client Acquisition - Exact Scripts

### Cold Email Template 1: "The Observation"

```
Subject: Saw you're hiring a {Role}

Hi {FirstName},

I saw on LinkedIn you're looking for a {Role} to handle {Task}.

Before you commit to a ${annual_salary}/year salary + training time, have you considered automating that specific workflow?

I recently built a system for {Similar_Company} that handles {Task} automatically for a one-time fee of ${setup_fee}. It works 24/7 and never calls in sick.

Open to a 10-min demo to see if it could save you that hire?

Best,
{Your_Name}
```

**When to Use:** Target companies actively hiring for automatable roles

---

### Cold Email Template 2: "The Pain Point"

```
Subject: Quick question about {pain_point}

Hi {FirstName},

I noticed {Company} is {observation_from_research}.

Quick question: Are you currently looking to {solve_specific_problem}?

If so, I'd love to share how we helped {Similar_Company} achieve {specific_result}.

Worth a quick chat?

Best,
{Your_Name}

PS: Here's a 2-min video showing exactly how it works: {loom_link}
```

---

### LinkedIn DM Template: "Value First"

```
Hey {FirstName},

I noticed {Company} is doing a lot of {Activity}.

I built a small tool that automates {Specific_Process} using AI.

I'd love to send you a free video showing how it works—might save your team 5-10 hours a week.

No pitch, just thought it would be useful. Want me to send the link?
```

---

### Discovery Call Script

```
OPENING (2 min):
"Thanks for taking the time today. I've got 30 minutes blocked—does that still work for you?

Great. Here's my plan: I'm going to ask you about your current processes, understand what's eating up time, and if there's a good fit, I'll share how we might automate it. Sound good?"

DISCOVERY QUESTIONS (15 min):
1. "Walk me through your typical day/week. Where do you get bogged down?"

2. "What's the one task you or your team hate doing the most?"

3. "How much time does that take per week?"

4. "What have you tried to solve this?"

5. "If you could wave a magic wand and automate one thing, what would it be?"

6. "What would it be worth to you if that was handled automatically?"

VALUE PROPOSITION (5 min):
"Based on what you shared, here's what I'm thinking...

[Explain solution in simple terms]

This would save you approximately {hours} hours per week.

At ${hourly_rate}/hour, that's ${annual_savings} per year.

The investment to build this is ${your_price}, which means you break even in {weeks} weeks."

CLOSE (5 min):
"Does this make sense as a next step?

[IF YES]:
"Great. I'll put together a detailed proposal by {date}. In the meantime, could you share [specific data/access I need]?"

[IF HESITANT]:
"What concerns do you have about moving forward?"

[Address concerns, then]:
"How about we start with a small pilot project—just automate {one_process} for ${smaller_price}. That way you can see the value before committing to the full system. Fair?"
```
